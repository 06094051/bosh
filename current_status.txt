We were using a director that can be controlled from ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/robinson
(there is a .envrc file there that should connect you with all the params)

A stemcell with a sha256 agent was uploaded and deployed to that director.
The vagrant machine that was used to create that director is running on robinson.
There is one vm deployed with that stemcell.  The instance is

   `jmeter_workers/ae8714c7-a410-46ef-bb15-ab1d7773783c`


On that instance there is a directory where we've been deploying the one-off sha256 stemcell with gobosh and bosh-init

   `/var/vcap/data/create-env`


To complete this story, there are several things that should happen:

  - bosh integration tests should run ( the far left tab on terminal on robinson should have results from a fly run)
      There were changes made to `drain.erb` that need to be committed and pushed. The changes are in ~/workspace/bosh

    check that both gocli and ruby cli tests will pass

  - gobosh create-env with the new stemcell. This is done and confirmed.

  - bosh-init deploy with the new stemcell. This is done and confirmed.


When these things are done and pass, the agent should be bumped and pushed
